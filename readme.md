# readme.md
this is a repo with, notes, guides, lists, etc
this is not really organized or anything,
best way to view it, is to use vscode,

git pull --recurse-submodules


## viewing on github?
change to the code view or raw link, 
otherwise most stuff will not look great,
lines will always show on a new line when "needed"
