# readme.md

this is a repo with, notes, guides, lists, etc
this is not really organized or anything,
best way to view it, is to use vscode,
for a graph view, use the foam extension (should be recommended when using vscode)

## viewing on github?
change to the code view or raw link, 
otherwise most stuff will not look great,
lines will always show on a new line when "needed"
