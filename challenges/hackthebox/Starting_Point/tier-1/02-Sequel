in this box

we found the port for a sql database

but we didnt find the version
thus we could try: nmap {boxip} -p 3306 -sC


connecting to the database
with the -u flag for a user
trying root

we could login to the database
and found a list of tables

we could dump the tables with the command
select * from {table name}
