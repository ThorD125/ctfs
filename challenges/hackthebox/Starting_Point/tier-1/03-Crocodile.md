in this box

we found an ftp with anonymous login,
it had 2 files, allowed.userlist and allowed.userlist.passwd

and also a http server


we needed an php file:
gobuster -x php -w wordlist -u {boxip}

using gobuster/guessing
we found the {boxip}/login.php

using the users/passwords we then logged in on the website
