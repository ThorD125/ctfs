this box

was the first box where nmap didnt instantly find the ports need

this was fixed with
nmap -sV {boxip} -p-
nmap -sV {boxip} -sV 6379



and this box made us familliar with redis

redis-cli -h
redis-cli -h {boxip}

select: we can select a database
dbsize

keys *: we see all keys
get {key}: get value of a key
