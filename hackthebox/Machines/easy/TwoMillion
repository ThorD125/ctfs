this has an ssh and web server open

checking the js we find some endpoints
this shows all the endpoints
/api/v1

we find we can register one

then we created a user and could login to the platform

we could upgrade our user to admin using:
/api/v1/admin/settings/update

and we found a command injection on this endpoint:
/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate

using this we could read the .env file
